# On Jeju anatomical terms: `yakaki` ‘neck’ and `twokmolop` ‘knee’

Already having diverged from Korean by the 15th c., Jeju features many terms without obvious cognates in the mainland.

Of these, I focus on two anatomical terms—`yakaki` ‘neck’ and `twokmolop` ‘knee’—and explore potential etymologies based on historical sources and modern reflexes in various languages.

## `yakaki`

The Jeju word `yakaki` ‘neck’ occurs in variation with `yakayki` and `yakaci`. Here, `yakayki` is a transparent derivation from `yakaki` via umlaut, and `yakaci` can be understood as an alternative suffix form `*yak-` + `-aci` c.f. `yakaki` < `*yak-` + `-aki`. Thus, we must investigate the origin of this root `*yak-`.

For this, I would like examine two Korean[^1] roots for ‘mouth’, `ip` and `*aku`. The former is not only found intact in Modern Korean but also thoroughly attested in Late Middle[^2][^3] and even Early Middle[^4] Korean. On the other hand, the latter is more speculative; given the standard Modern Korean `akali` ‘mouth’, I propose a comparative examination of various dialectal (and historical) forms as follows[^5].

1. `akwu` (==NK[^6]==), `akwu-thwui` (==NK==), `akwu-thingi` (==NK==), `akwu-thwong` (==NJ, SJ, NK==), `akwu-chang` (==SJ, NK==), `akwu-ttak` (==SJ==), `akwu-thayngi` (==NJ==)
    1. `akwuy` (==JJ==), `ip-akwoy`[^7]
    2. `aku-ttak` (==SJ==)
2. `akali` (==SJ, JJ, NP, NK==), `akwuli` (==SJ, JJ==)
    1. `akal-thwong` (==NK==), `akwul-ci` (==NJ==)
3. `akwuci` (==SK, NJ, SJ==), `akwoci` (==SJ==)
    1. `akamci` (==SK==)
4. `ak-thwungi` (==NP==), `ak-pal` (==SJ==), `ak-pali` (==NK==), `ak-cayki` (==NP==)

The above list shows a grouping of the different word forms based on shared characteristics. Group 1 forms all appear to suggest a root `akwu`. Group 1.1’s *akwuy*, then, would best be analyzed as `akwu` + `-i`, with `akwoy` being its ablaut form. Group 1.2’s `aku` is similar to Group 1 except it lacks the rounding on the vowel; more on this later. 

Groups 2 and 3 forms appear to be transparent derivations from a root `*ak(V)` with the suffixes `-Vli` and `-Vci`, respectively. Group 2.1 forms appear additionally to have undergone elision of the final `-i` and another step of compounding with suffixes `-thwong` and `-ci`. Group 3.1’s `akamci` would be best understood as a form of `*akaci` with nasal epenthesis.

Finally, Group 4 forms suggest a root `*ak`.

From this, we can see two things. First, `akali` and all of its alternate forms examined above can be explained through a common root `*akV`. Second, this common root `*akV` has a propensity to become `*ak-` in compounds, not only before vowels but also before consonants. This tendency makes it less likely that the original form would have had a labialized vowel as in `akwu~*akwo`. It stands to reason, then, that the original form was most likely `*aku`.

With that, I further propose that `*yak` from above is a compound of `ip` and `*aku`. In Middle Korean, we see a hypothetical cognate `ip-akwoy`, meaning ‘lip’[^8]. We have reason to suspect that `p`-lenition was a productive change within Jeju, with words like `iyaki` ‘conversation’[^9], `mipap` ‘cooked rice’[^10], and `-path` ‘field’ having `W` > `w` exclusively in Jeju: `iwak` ‘conversation’, `miwap` ‘rice’, and `was` ‘-field’. Applying this to `*ip-aku` yields a hypothetical reflex `*iWaku~iwaku`.

Next, we consider `*iWa~iwa` > `*ya`. The elision (or assimilation) of `w` in between `i` and `a` does not seem particularly far-fetched, with examples such as Northern Pyeongan `piat-` ‘to spit’ (consider Middle Korean `piWath-`[^11] > `*piwat(h)-` > `piat(h)-`) and `iyaki` ‘conversation’ above. Such a change yields `*yaku`; we have already established above that the final `u` vowel in `*aku` has a propensity to be elided or absorbed in compounds, finally yielding the alternate `*yak-` as in `yakaki`.

Admittedly, ‘lip’ and ‘neck’ is not a common polysemy. However, considering broader senses of each root, ‘mouth’[^12] and ‘throat’[^13], we see that the colexification of this semantic pair is indeed attested.

Thus, I put forth the derivational chain Korean *ip* ‘mouth’ + `*aku` ‘mouth’ > Jeju `*ipaku` > `*iWaku` > `*iwaku` > `*iaku` > `*yaku` ‘mouth’ > ‘throat’ +  `-aki` > * as the etymology of Jeju `yakaki` ‘throat, neck’.

## `twokmolop`

Next, looking at this Jeju word for ‘knee’ and its variants, three things immediately stand out:
1. `-molop` reflects Korean `mwuluph` ‘knee’ (< Middle Korean `mwulwuph` ‘knee’)
2. There are many variant forms, including `twokmeli`, `twok-mwulep`, and `twok`
3. There are compounds `twokmolop-kkwang`, `tokmoli-kkwang`, and `toksayki-kkwang` (and several other variations thereof), all meaning ‘kneecap’

From points 1 and 2, it is clear that `twok-molop` is a compound of `twok` and `molop`, both components independently meaning ‘knee’. Regarding point 3, the suffix `-kkwang` commonly appears in words for bones; specifically regarding `toksayki-kkwang`, the component `sayki` is also found in words such as `kwol-paksayki` ‘skull’, further supporting the idea that `twok` is an independent root meaning ‘knee’.

The alternate `o` vowel in `tokmoli-` and `toksayki-` are somewhat curious. However, given that these are the only two instances of it, it is probably best analyzed as the product of a local sound change (perhaps due to assimilation or neutralization) from the original `twok` form.

Thence, we can evaluate potential cognates. Most notably, Korean has `twokani` ‘kneecap, (animal’s) knee’, which seems like an obvious candidate; however, there is a striking lack of both historical and dialectal forms.

One may note some Northern Jeolla dialects, which feature `twoka`~`twokani`~`twokaci` ‘large clay pot’. `twokani` in particular would seem to be `twok + **-ani`, transparently linked to standard `twok` ‘large clay pot’ (< MK `twòk`[^14]). While there is no direct semantic relationship between the two homophonous forms, the morphological parallel allows us again to extract a root `twok` 'knee'.

Now looking outside of Korean, a tempting candidate at first sight is Manchu *takiya* ‘animal’s knee’ and *takitu* ‘leather knee pad’. We can reasonably reconstruct a root *\*taki-* meaning knee, noting also that the usage of *takiya*[^17] mirrors that of Korean `twokani`. This form is potentially related to Mongolian *takim* ‘back of the knee’, which in turn I posit to be a doublet of *takiyi-* ‘to bend’; considering ‘back of the knee’ and ‘to bend’ to come from the same root *\*taqi-*, we would expect the original meaning of this root to be ‘to bend’, and for the ‘knee’ sense to be a later development that was borrowed into Manchu.

This is a close semantic parallel to Korean `wokum` ‘back of the knee (human)’, which originally meant bent parts of one’s body[^18] but is now almost exclusively used to mean the back of the knee. Further, while `twokani`’s poorly attested history hinders diachronic analyses, `twokani` and `wokum` are often seen as semantic counterparts in modern usage, the former being used for people and the latter for animals. However, we again find contrary phonological evidence; even overlooking the final `-i`, the expected Middle Korean reflex of a hypothetical Middle Mongolian *\*taq-* would be `*tak`~`thak`~`takh`~`thakh-`, not `twok-`. This makes the connection less plausible.

***

Instead, we will investigate Mongolian <code class="ignore">toyiɣ</code> ‘kneecap’. Unlike <code class="ignore">taqi-</code>, *toyiɣ* is not only a semantic match but—seemingly—also a phonological one. While it is difficult to ascertain the precise phonological processes surrounding Middle Mongolian loanage into Korean, we can comparatively study other apparent loans to evaluate whether a Mongolian *toyiɣ* could have resulted in a Middle Korean reflex `*twok`. 

Middle Mongolian *t-* is often associated with Korean `th-` as in `them(w)ul` < *temür*, `thwikwon` < *toyiɣun*, `tharak` < *taraɣ*, and `thyellik` < *terlig*. However, there are instances of Korean `t-` as well, such as `takal` < *taqa* and `twokwom` < *toqom*. The latter of the two, `twokwom` < *toqom*, is especially promising, since it is a Jeju dialectal form[^19]. It also brings us to our second point, which is `wo` < *o*: This correspondence is attested in numerous other borrowings as well, including `kwotwoli` < *godoli*, `kwongkwol` < *qongɣor*, `nwoyen` < *noyan*, and many more. Skipping ahead a bit, our third point—the loanage of final *-ɣ* > `-k`—is also attested: `tharak` < *taraɣ*, `aktay` < *aɣta*, `swulwuk` < *sürüɣ*, and `aymak` < *aimaɣ*. This leaves us with just *-yi-* to consider.

*-yi-* poses somewhat of a challenge. For our proposed correspondence `*twok` < *toyiɣ*, we would need *-yi-* to map to `∅`. I was only able to verify two examples of Mongolian borrowings containing *-yi-*: `thwikwon` < *toyiɣun* and `*cyapwul`[^20] < *čayibur*. In the former, *-oyi-* clearly maps to the diphthong `-wi-`, but in the latter, *-ayi-* seems to map to `-a-`[^21]. This is by no means conclusive evidence that a *yi* > `∅` loanage occurred; there are too many variables in the phonological environment, namely the already existent `y-` glide in `cy` as well as the lack of a checked coda. Nevertheless, I posit that the deletion of `-yi-` either during or following the hypothetical borrowing of *toyiɣ* is not implausible.

With this, I put forth the derivational chain Middle Mongolian *toyiɣ* ‘kneecap’ > Middle Korean `*twok` ‘kneecap’ +  `*molop` ‘knee’ > * as the etymology of Jeju `twokmolop` ‘knee’.

## Afterword

It must be stressed that a lot of the theorization thus far lacks a solid evidential basis. This is somewhat of a natural consequence of working with such little data; regardless, it is my wish that the methodologies and ideas hitherto presented provide a basis for future research. At the least, I enjoyed the creative exercise.

[^5]: I personally suspect that `akami` ‘gill’ and `akwungi` ‘furnace’ also share the same root. Including these in the analysis would have expanded the number of data points; however, since I did not note any noteworthy characteristics in the dialectal forms of `akami` or `akwungi` that were not already captured by those of `akali`, they were deliberately omitted as to limit the scope of discussion.

[^8]: 훈몽자회37a - 吻 **입아괴〮** 믄〯; 吻 is a character  meaning ‘lip’, ‘corner of the mouth’.
[^9]: This word does not have a `p` in the central language, even its earliest attestation in the early 17th century having a glide: 서궁일기74b - **녜아기** 사마 보려 ᄂᆡ인들이 잠간 긔록ᄒᆞ노라​. However, many dialectal forms have a `p`, suggesting that the `iyaki` form is the product of lenited `p` > `W` > `w` > `y`.
[^10]: While the standard language technically only recognizes `ssalpap` for this meaning, `mipap` is a transparent compound of Sino-Korean 米 `mi` ‘rice grain’ (equivalent to native `ssal`) and `pap` ‘steamed grain’.

[^12]: While the cognate `ip-akwoy` appears to mean ‘lip’ or ‘corner of the mouth’ in Middle Korean, since `*yaku` here is ultimately a compound of two roots meaning ‘mouth’, there is no reason why the original meaning could not have been ‘mouth’.
[^13]: Both Korean and Jeju colexify ‘neck’ and ‘throat’. In other words, `yakaki` (as well as its Korean counterpart `mok(-aci)`) can mean both ‘neck’ and' ‘throat’.

[^19]: In fact, Jeju seems to possess a relatively high number of such Mongolian loanwords, making a Mongolian-based etymology for `twokmolop` synchronically appropriate.
[^20]: Here, `*cyapwul` is actually seen as `cyampwul`. However, given the phonemic environment (Vp) and the lack of a nasal in *čayibur*, the `m` is appropriately analyzed as nasal epenthesis, yielding `*cyapwul` as the original form. This is also consistent with the earlier Sinographic transcription 者佛.
[^21]: The glide in the `cy-` onset reflects Middle Mongolian *č-*.
