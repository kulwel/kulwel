> **床前明月光、疑是紙上章**

This blog is a place for sketches on Korean historical linguistics, among other things. Thoughts may not be complete at time of initial posting. Any ramblings or errors will be continuously, albeit seldom, revised.

Either **Yale Romanization**[^1] or Unicode-encoded Hangul is used to write Korean words. I deviate from Martin (1992) in three ways: all Koreanic forms are rendered using Middle Korean Yale conventions; that is, Modern Korean 요리 is `ywoli`, not `yoli`, and Jeju ᄒᆞᆫ저 is `honce`. Tones are marked as necessary using diacritics: `à` (low), `á` (high), `ǎ` (rising), `a` (omitted or determined via pitch assignment rules). Finally, readings of Sinographs are not capitalized unless it would be contextually beneficial for clarity. I also deviate from Sejong (1446) in three ways: unless quoting verbatim, ᅟᆢ, ᅟᆖ is used for `yo`, `yu` instead of ᅟᆝ, ᅟᆜ. Tone dots are placed above, instead of to the left of, Hangul blocks[^2]. Most importantly, unless quoting, coda neutralization (八字可足用也) is not reflected, instead faithfully reproducing the morphophonemic form.

[^2]: For instance, 나랏〮말〯ᄊᆞ미〮. This is an adaptation for horizontal writing inspired by [Chocassye](https://find.됬.xyz/). It is a purely visual embellishment, thus copying-and-pasting will yield normal Unicode tone dots.

References are given roughly following APA 7, though again deviations are made for simplicity. Most notably, titles are not italicized. Which copies were used of historical texts are not explicitly cited unless relavent. Titles of historical texts may be given as abbreviations; below is a nonexaustive list.
